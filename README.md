# SC1015 : Evaluation on whether some anime are worth watching 
## Motivation : 
We would like to find some anime that would be worth watching. However, there are too many options to choose from on the site with which the data has been indirectly retrieved from: myAnimeList.com
So, through this project, we decided to narrow down some anime which can act as sort of a “starting point” for watching.
We are therefore, mostly interested in examining overall popularity, ranking, and favourites, and how these might be affected by other variables, such as genres, episode duration, or number of episodes.

## Goals : 
Our project aims to help people narrow down the anime titles that are worth a watch.

## Dataset Used:
We use the Kraggle "MyAnimeList Dataset".

# Overview of Project Outline:
## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Explore, visualized and our insights on the EDA 
- Maturity Rating
- Anime Duration
- Genres 
- Studios
- Members

## 2. Regression Models 
- Ridge Regression 
- Lasso Regression 
- Elastic Net Regression Model (BEST) 

## 3. Classification Models
- Decision Tree Classifier (Best)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Findings/conclusion
We can reliably predict whether an anime is worth watching mainly from the popularity, and score, which in turn can be predicted with genres (most animes that are popular belong the comedy, action and adventure genres), as well as favourites, and episode duration.

We learnt about the different models for regression, as well as one more model for classification.
